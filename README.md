# BOXX-Type Controller

This repository contains "building-block" stl-files to create a BOXX-Type controller.


## Elements and Measurements of the modular components

### Raw half
- Carved out half of the controller without any keyswitch holes or reinforcements
- Outside: 180mm x 170mm x 30mm
- Inside:	170mm x 160mm x 25mm
- Edges and surface: 5mm thick

### Screw Reinforcements Corners
- Reinforcements for the screws at the corners and along the edges
- Reinfrocement blocks: 10mm x 10mm x 20mm
- Screw hole: 3mm diameter x 8mm depth

### Connection Pieces
- Connect both halfs through the middle
- Pin: 5mm diameter x 15mm length
- Pin-hole: 5.22mm diameter x 5mm depth
- Screw hole (big): 7mm
- Screw hole (small): (combined) 3mm each 
- Note: The connection pieces are intended to have a 10mm wall between them. The small screw hole is for the screw to be screwed in, while the big screw hole just indicates the spot and reduces the distance to the other connection piece

### Backplate
- Attaches to the back of the controller
- Backplate: 170mm x 160mm x 5mm
- Screw holes: 3mm diameter x 5mm depth

### Elevation
- Elevates and hides the screws from the backplate of the controller, so that the screws do not touch the surface its standing on.
- Elevation: 10mm diameter x 2mm height
- Ring on top of elevation: 10mm diameter x 3mm height with a 7mm diameter x 3mm height carve in
- Screw hole: 3mm diameter x 3mm depth

### Support Beam
- Enhances durability of the backplates
- Support Beam: 10mm diameter x 20mm height
